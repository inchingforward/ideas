ideas
=====

Just some app ideas I've had.  I wrote a [blog post](http://inchingforward.blogspot.com/2014/08/2014-clojure-cup-ideas.html) with some of these for the 2014 [Clojure Cup](http://clojurecup.com/).  I thought I'd stick them here in case I (or you) want to add to them.

Some of these have been done, but that's no reason not to think about or investigate them.  If you're interested in working on one of these, take it and have fun.  If you want a collaborator, [let me know](http://mikejanger.net).

## Word Auction 
An author signs up for this site and presents a list of article/tutorial/post ideas for readers to choose from.  Readers choose the next article/tutorial/post during a set number of days by voting with their wallets.  The item that garners the most money wins, and the author writes the material and publishes it on the site. The author gets the majority of the funds raised and owns the article/tutorial/post. 

## In the Mood
Given a target mood, this service finds books, movies, music, etc. to match your mood.

## Storytellers
Connect with up to 3 others and collaboratively build a story by taking turns writing in units of paragraph, sentence, or word.  Once the story is finished, publish it to a reading section of the site for others to read. 

## Version Check
Upload a project.clj file to this web service and you'll be told which libraries you're using that have newer versions.

## Destination Helper
Specify a travel destination + dates of travel and get back details about the destination for that time period:  weather, events, the most recent highly-rated restaurant reviews, etc.

## Web-based Podcatcher
Log in, subscribe to feeds and listen without the need for a dedicated app.   Is it possible to supplant native apps with a web offering?

## Due Today
Yes, this is another TODO list, but it's the only one I've been able to use consistently.  You're only allowed to add items to today's date.  If you don't complete an item, you have the option to move it to today from an earlier date.  The focus is on entering actionable steps that can be achieved today.

## Single Subject Search Engine
Indexing the entire internet is impossible for a sole developer with a VPS.  Would it be possible to index a niche subject?  What advantages would you have over a general search engine?

## Source Code Recommender
You've learned the basics of a new language.  You've solved some puzzles.  You're still not comfortable writing in the language.  Where do you go to see how advanced users of the language use it?  With Source Code Recommender, reviewers can submit code repos that they think exemplify the best practice patterns and idioms of a language and rate/discuss/review/educate based on the source.

## Goodreads Reviewer Suggester
Given your account, this site uses the Goodreads API to find other users that ranked books similarly to you.   Receive suggestions for users to follow, books to read, or discussions to take part in.

## Newsletter Aggregator
Email newsletters have taken off in popularity.  This service aggregates all of your newsletters in one place.  Sign up for an account and the service will supply you with an email address to use when signing up for newsletters.  The aggregator then provides you with an interface for reading/managing/tagging/searching your newsletters.

## Monument
Memories for locations.  Search for a location on a map and add a memory (anonymously if you want) about that particular place/establishment/location.  Flaco's Tacos, I still miss you.

## IT Interview Quiz
A site that quizzes you on those silly puzzles (and/or useful CS theory) that some companies use to filter the hiring pool.  Submit answers to quizzes (anonymously if you want) and have them reviewed/rated by others and learn from other member's submissions.  This is kind of an [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) for theory.
